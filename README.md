# Roomie

Project which I am developing for people who would like to find roomie in Norway with similar interests, hobbies and personality.

Roomie is a project bootstrapped with Create React App. 

You have to install node and npm to start this project.

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10 on your local development machine.

npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. 

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
